## taxonomic assignment of contigs

## 139 single copy gnees

## E coli representative genomes selection

## Anvio

We selected samples with abundance E coli, E faecalis and B vulgatus based on the estimated abundance from Metaphlan2. Single species contigs were then filtered and we ran Anvio pangenome analysis separately. The raw Anvio results are [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tqrchvqmdv95nxx/AAA4mDF0t0lit4Kk2-nBHCzfa?dl=0).
